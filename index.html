        <h1>About the Console Screen and Visual Studio </h1>
        <p>
             Visual Studio is an coding IDE. 
             I am using it right now!
             You have to first install it on your device. 
             Then you have to follow the steps it shows to set it up on your device. 
             After you set it up accroding to you liking, you can start coding!
             Create a folder, open it up on VS (Visual Studio) and create something awesome!! :)
        </p>
        <p>
            The console sreen is a tool coders use.
            Console is generally known as the output screen in programming where we can compile and execute programs by giving commands.
            We can give inputs and see the outputs. 
            We can also log stuff using the console.log and open it up in the console screen.
            We can do that by right-clicking on our mouse, then clicking on Inspect and going to the console screen at the top. 
            Go ahead and try it now! 
            See what is there!! :)

            console.log("This Is The Console Screen")
            var first_name = "Tejaswi";
            var last_name = "Budhi";
            console.log(first_name);
            console.log(last_name);
            var full_name= first_name.concat(" "+last_name);
            console.log(full_name);
            var x= 211;
            var y= 879;
            var add= x+y;
            console.log(add);
            var multiply= x*y;
            console.log(multiply);
            var pow= Math.pow (x,2);
            console.log(pow);
            console.log("Thanks for checking the console out!! :)");
